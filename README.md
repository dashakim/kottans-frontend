Good idea to start from "a tiny world" task, I don't pay attention on high part of OOP principles and just start from basic structure. Later, I will improve my task? so it will look DRY and SOLID)

Ok, there was challenge for me. I saw this task solved from another students. I saw couple tutorials how to solve this task. It helps to understand what is going on, but write by myself really hard. Also a changed enemy character because bugs looks scares. Still I need to learn deeper because I feel my knowledge it's not enough to write whole game.
